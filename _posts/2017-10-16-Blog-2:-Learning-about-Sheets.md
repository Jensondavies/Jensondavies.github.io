**Learning about Sheets**

In today's lesson we started to learn about how to use sheets, it was just simple things like adding and multiplying. The formula for multiplying is: =B3*B4*B5*B6*B7 or =product(B3:B7). It's very easy to do these and it's very helpful. The formula for addition is: =SUM(D3:D7). These shortcuts can show you how to do things quicker.
