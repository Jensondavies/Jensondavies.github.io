**How to Stock**

In today's lesson we learnt how stock sheets work and how useful they can be. We looked at how to stock items and show how many of something there is or how many have been sold and so on. Sheets has really made me realise how helpful it can be and how many different things you can. The fact you can stock just using 5 minutes of your time is so good. You can do any item at any price and as many of it as you want.
