**?**

Now you're probably wondering why I have used a question mark for the title. Well unfortunately I missed the fourth lesson of the yearâ€¦ I wasn't very well, so I missed out on some of the Google sheets work. But due to that I'm going to write about something else today. Something I've been doing for a while and is also my passion. Now that something is karate. There are many different types of karate but I only focus on one which is: Shotokan - ryu. This is probably the most popular karate and is used most. I have been doing Shotokan for 9 years, and I'm currently a 1st Dan Black belt. It's something I've always wanted to be and it's the best feeling to know I've achieved it. The exam was very hard and took two and a half hours to complete but was completely worth it.
