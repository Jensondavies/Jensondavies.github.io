**Finally Back**

So after me being ill last week I was back to school and had IT first period. Back to Google sheets! So what happened in today's lesson? We went back to looking at stocking and how places use it to work. We looked at the stock table from a couple of weeks ago and we thought about how to do a discount code and make it work. It was very complicated and I found it hard to understand. But at the end of the lesson I started to get the hang of it.
