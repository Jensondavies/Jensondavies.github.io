**First lesson**

Our first lesson back was surprisingly fun. Everyone was excited to be back and there was a good vibe in air. We got told we were going to start looking at spreadsheets (Google Sheets). The point of learning all this is to help you in later life and get organised about any kind of situation I guess. Google Sheets is a great source to stack information or work things out. We have six lesson till the end of half term and I am going to try my best.
